\title{Read and aggregate GeoJSON files from a directory or file path}
\usage{
read_geojson(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A file path or directory path. If a directory is provided, all
files matching the pattern \verb{*.geojson}, \verb{*.json}, \verb{*.geojson.gz},
or `*.json.gz will be read.}
}
\value{
A named list of \code{sf} objects, where names correspond to the
extracted base names from the files.
\itemize{
\item Each element contains the spatial features from one or more files.
}
}
\description{
This function reads one or more GeoJSON or JSON files (optionally compressed
with \code{.gz}) from a given path. Files are grouped and aggregated by their
base name (after removing extensions and the prefix before the last \code{-}).
If multiple files share the same base name, they are merged into a single
\code{sf} object using \code{rbind}.
}
\details{
File names are processed as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Remove the \code{.gz} extension if present.
\item Remove the \code{.geojson} or \code{.json} extension.
\item Keep only the part after the last dash (\code{-}).
}

Gzipped files are decompressed into a temporary location before reading.

\dontrun{
# Read all GeoJSON files from a directory
data_list <- read_geojson("path/to/geojson_dir")

# Read a single GeoJSON file
data_list <- read_geojson("path/to/file.geojson")

# Access an aggregated dataset
my_layer <- data_list[["numvoie"]]
}
